This animation will show a car that is moving forward with proper tire rotation. Also, it will show some background skyboxes with some tree objects.
To start the program, user must be download Xcode and includes OpenGL library with SOIL.
I used SOIL (Simple OpenGL Image Loader) to load texture. After running program, user can start the program by clicking 'q' keyboard.

#Car Model
I downloaded the model from this website: http://animium.com/2011/10/ferrari-california-3d-model.
