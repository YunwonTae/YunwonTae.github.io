What are the differences between Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence?

Today lots of computer scientists or engineers are extremely excited about the “Artificial Intelligence” because it is really powerful technique, which will contribute a lot for future technology. However, after many scientists jumping into this area, many other terms came out and people start to used each term interchangeably even though each term has its own specific definition. For the following article, I will try to give a clear definition about each term, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

Why each term Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning used interchangeably?
======
Before the idea of Machine Learning and Deep Learning came out, computer scientists made Artificial Intelligence with complex rules or decision trees, but this strategy could only handle particular inputs to output the result. For instance, if I give input “food”, it could only give specific outputs that already built on machine. However, people, who do not know about rules that programed on machine, will think the machine as AI machine. Moreover, because of movies like Iron Man or I Robot, which shows and gives fantasy about Artificial Intelligence, we would probably think AI as any robots that act like human. People start to think if machine works automatically, they called machine as Artificial Intelligence. However, there was a big downside about this complex decision tree because if we try to give a million of inputs to a machine, it is impossible to handle those inputs with only complex rules or decision trees. This is the reason why computer scientists brought the idea of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. And this is reason that if people search regarding Artificial Intelligence, they get terms, Machine Learning and Deep Learning as well. Because of this circumstance, Artificial Intelligence sometimes used interchangeably with Machine Learning or Deep Learning, but we should not use these terms interchangeably.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
======
If we search the definition of Artificial Intelligence on wikipedia, following definition will come up. “AI is intelligenceLinks to an external site. demonstrated by machinesLinks to an external site., in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals”. AI is intelligence that simulates human intelligence. AI can divide into two categories, strong AI and weak AI. If machine intelligence can learn and train by itself, we consider it as strong intelligence. If machine intelligence cannot learn or be trained, we consider it as weak intelligence. In other words, we can treat Artificial Intelligence as anything that simulates human intelligence. It is like a topic on machine intelligence, but under this topic, it has many different methods to make it happen.

What is Machine Learning?
======
To imitate human intelligence, we need lots of data to make decision. For example, when we go to a restaurant, we choose menu based on our information. Human always make decision based on their information. However, human does not just get information from database. Human improves intelligence through learning and training. And this is where Machine Learning concept comes up. Machine Learning is a form of algorithms that help machine to learn or to get trained. In other words, Machine Learning is one of method to make Artificial Intelligence. When we give huge amount of datas to machine, machine will use those data to learn. And this will improve machine intelligence to make decision. So it is like self learning and enhance the knowledge to give better results. To make this happens, computer scientists made lots of algorithms. And we started to call these algorithms as Machine Learning.

What is Deep Learning?
======
When I started to study about artificial intelligence, I was so confused between this two terms, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Although I asked my friend, who is majoring computer science, she also could not give clear definition. After searching these terms, I could figure out that Deep Learning is advance version of Machine Learning or we can think that Deep Learning is subset of Machine Learning. As I mentioned above, machine learning makes decision based on inputs information. Machine Learning cannot correct their results. However, deep learning can correct results and it will improve the future results. Deep Learning was inspired by human brain. The structure of algorithms like RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) imitates human neural network. Hence, using this deep learning, we can make machine brain that acts like human brain.

This source compares between machine learning and deep learning. It helps me to understand the differences between these two, DL and ML.
