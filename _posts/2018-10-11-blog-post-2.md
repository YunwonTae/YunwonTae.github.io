This is a blog post which was inspired by this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-Fe9Ekxxj).

What is Linear Regression?
======
Previous blog post, we talked about general terms about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. And this blog post will talk about linear regression because I want to share this simple example so that readers whoever want to study this concept can understand it more easily. Linear Regression is basic model that we commonly apply to our machine learning concept. I am going to briefly explain about general Linear Regression and will show a very simple example to demonstrate this model. I will use given training dataset which is presented in table 1. And this learning style is called supervised learning. I hope that people will understand and be more familiar with this linear regression model after reading this blog. I will also add some useful sources at the end of this blog so that readers can study more about this.

| Hours(x)  | Points(y)  |
| --------- | ---------- |
|    1      |     2      |
|    2      |     4      |
|    3      |     6      |
|    4      |     ?      |

**Table 1: What would be the points if we study 4 hours?**

Aren't headings cool?
