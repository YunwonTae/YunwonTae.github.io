This is a blog post which was inspired by this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-Fe9Ekxxj).

What is Linear Regression?
======
Previous blog post, we talked about general terms about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. And this blog post will talk about linear regression because I want to share this simple example so that readers whoever want to study this concept can understand it more easily. Linear Regression is basic model that we commonly apply to our machine learning concept. I am going to briefly explain about general Linear Regression and will show a very simple example to demonstrate this model. I will use given training dataset which is presented in table 1. And this learning style is called supervised learning. I hope that people will understand and be more familiar with this linear regression model after reading this blog. I will also add some useful sources at the end of this blog so that readers can study more about this.

| Hours(x)  | Points(y)  |
| --------- | ---------- |
|    1      |     2      |
|    2      |     4      |
|    3      |     6      |
|    4      |     ?      |

**Table 1: What would be the points if we study 4 hours?**

General Explanation about Linear Regression
======
Linear Regression is the model that uses linear predictor functions to estimate unknown parameters. Perhaps this definition confuses reader more. Hence, I would like to give some concrete example that we should use linear regression model. For instance, how long should I study in order to receive good grades? I want to predict my grades depending on my time that I spent. And we assume that we have data like table 1. As we can see, we know that if we study 1 hour, we can receive 2 points, and if we study 2 hours, we will get 4 points. However, what points should we get if we study 4 hours? Fortunately, we can predict this table using linear regression model. Next paragraph will introduce the linear function that will solve this table 1. We will continue to use this table 1 as an example to demonstrate linear regression.

Definition of Linear Function
======
Usually, linear regression function forms as y = w*x+b, where y is response variable, w is random variable, x is predictor variable, and b is coefficient variable. However for the simplicity, I will drop the coefficient variable and use only y, w, and x which will form as like y = w*x. Since we defined our general function, letâ€™s plug in the data into our function, y = w*x. As I mentioned previously, I will use same data that I created on table 1.
