Background
======
Today there are many other machine learning methods. In a previous blog post, we defined Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Also, we compared each terms and differentiated using each own definition. As I mentioned in a previous blog post, deep learning is one of methods for machine learning. However, there is another method for machine learning which is called reinforcement learning. For this particular blog post, I would like to talk about reinforcement learning which is one of machine learning method. Since this reinforcement learning becomes big interests because of Go artificial intelligence, I started to read articles and watched David Silver’s online lectures. He is in research group called “DeepMind” for reinforcement learning and contributed to make Go AI.

I will not cover this topic in detail; however, I will write some of basic concepts of reinforcement learning. I hope that readers can have some intuition about this topic so that they can study this algorithm more easily.

What is Reinforcement Learning?
======
Reinforcement learning is a type of algorithm for machine learning. Unlike other machine learning methods, this reinforcement learning is really helpful for game theory and control theory because machine can develope by itself using several experiences. Usually, we divide reinforcement learning into three main parts, environment, agents, and interpreter. And the algorithm will flow same as above picture. Agent will make action based on state. Environment will get an input that agnet made action with a state. And environment will output the result to interpreter. Interpreter will observe environment’s output and will reward a point to agent if the action was correct. If the agent’s action was not correct, the agent will not be rewarded from interpreter. This is the most basic concept of reinforcement learning. Perhaps this explanation might confuse readers more. Hence, I would like to reference other blog that gave a simple example to understand this concept. If reader wants to read more about this blog, reader can find the source at the end of this blog. The example made this hypothesis. There is a child in a living room. And if we apply this simple hypothesis to reinforcement learning algorithm, the child would be an agent because child makes action which is touching fire or getting closer to fire. The environment would be the rule that gets a result from the child’s action and outputs the next state to interpreter. And interpreter would be parents because they have to observe their child. Now we provide rules to environment that if child touches the fire, a child will lose the point. However, if child just gets closer to fire, he will earn the point because fire makes him warm. Child will repeat this procedure until he can understand that he should not touch the fire. We used human example to get some intuition about reinforcement learning. For the next section, I want to give some examples that machine can apply this reinforcement learning algorithm.

Examples of Reinforcement Learning
======
As I mentioned above, reinforcement learning is very useful for game theory. One of the example would be pong game. Pong game is just simple 2D game that each user tries to defense the ball from each other. If we apply reinforcement learning to this game theory, we can build powerful AI computer that can always beat the users. Usually, most of reinforcement learning developers use this kind of simple example to simulate their algorithm. In this pong example, agent is a paddle because paddles moves up and down to defense the ball. Environment would be that if ball passses the paddle, agent will lose the point. However, if the ball passes opponent paddle, agent will earn the point. Every time paddle moves up and down, the machine will save each pixel positions. And based on previous rewarded experience, machine will make same movement to earn the point. Our goal is to maximize the reward point.

The other example of reinforcement learning is Go. Go is similar to chess game, but it has more states and more complicated ways to win. If we think of the possible moves for Go, it is sometimes compared with number of atoms in the universe. Hence, it is impossible to implement an AI player with datas. However, the company called DeepMind implemented artificial intelligence which can play Go. And this AI won some of professional Go players. One of the professional Go player would be Lee See Dol who is ranked in 9 (ranking 9 is highest rank in Go) for Go. Since Go is really complicated game, I won’t give some detail about how reinforcement learning had been applied to this game. However, I can give some basic ideas. In Go, we have multiple states, which are points on board. Action is every time the agent (AI player) places the stone on a point. When agent gets more territory than opponent, environment will reward the point to agent on that specific movements. Machine will save these movements and will use for next game. In this example, the main goal is also to maximize reward points.

Conclusion
======
Understanding the reinforcement learning is too complicated. However, I hope my blog post gives some intuition regarding reinforcement learning so that readers can use this intuition to study this concept.

The title is called “An introduction to Reinforcement Learning”. This source uses fire example and I have used this example to explain reinforcement learning. Since this blog contains more about math computation to explain how the algorithm works, I would like to recommend readers to watch this online tutorial, RL Course by David Silver - Lecture 1: Introduction to Reinforcement LearningLinks to an external site.. The lecturer is David Silver who contributed to make GO artificial intelligence.

[http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/), this is other useful source which uses pong example and other example to explain about reinforcement learning. This source is also hard to understand since it contains some of math computation. Thus, I recommend readers to watch David Silver’s lectures first and read these sources.
